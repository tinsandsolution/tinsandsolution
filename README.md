### Hi, I’m Lara!
### About

I wrote my first line of code in middle school, something in a powershell script because I dreaded the idea of manually renaming hundreds of files across dozens of nested directories. Since then, I've continued paying attention to ways to automate boring tasks in my life to free up time for actually living.

In my quest to become a full-stack software developer, I made a clone of Kalshi and PredictIt called PredictThat that lets users create markets and place fake money bets on outcomes of real world-events! It was a fitting capstone project at AppAcademy, where I learned JavaScript, Python, React/Redux, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express, Python, CSS, and HTML.

In my free time, I like taking my friend's dog for walks, playing chess, and advocating for affordable housing in my neighborhood!
